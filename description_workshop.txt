A mod that brings joy and pleasure.

Ladies and gentlemen, the brand-new Mark’s Mod, developed specifically to bring new weapons to the game.

Here are some new items:

1)Diamond Sword – Powerful enough to defeat most enemies. The sprite was made by me.

2)Mark Gun – A good weapon with a wide range. The main benefit is the sound - Suiii. Its bullets bounce and ricochet. The bullets you can use are diamond bullets.

3)Diamond Bullets – As I said earlier, these are basic items designed specifically for the Mark Gun. The ability to craft or obtain them in Survival mode will be added later; for now, you can get them in Creative mode.

4)Minecraft Crafting Table – I forgot to mention that to craft all these mind-blowing weapons, you need to use the Minecraft crafting table.

5)Diamond Armor – In development…


I hope you like my first mod. I may add more changes in the future.
